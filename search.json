The technological twist on this setup is that players can ask game characters anything they like and the characters will answer back. The game uses generative AI to shape dialogue in response to the player’s questions, and players have the option to interact through voice or keyboard input."

    "text": "Application of AI\nDead Meat’s responsive dialogue is generated by language models. Early versions of the game used cloud-based large language models (LLM), but cloud-based LLMs introduce cost and latency issues, as well requiring players to have an always-on internet connection. Meaning Machine has since partnered with Nvidia to fine-tune a language model that is small enough to run locally, on a player’s GPU. The model was fine-tuned on Meaning Machine’s own dialogue data and is now integrated with the company’s Game Conscious AI system.\n\n\n\n\n\n“We are pretty optimistic about AI… not as a productivity tool, not as something to build things faster and cheaper. We are optimistic about AI as something that can unlock new forms of creative self-expression for developers and create new types of experience for players that radically change the shape of what video games look like.”\n\n\n\n Thomas Keane, co-founder and creative lead, Meaning Machine speaking at Game Developers Conference, May 1, 2025"

    "text": "Applying the CoSTAR Foresight Lab AI roadmap\nOur AI roadmap is organised around three strategic outcomes – frameworks, targeted support and growth – and driven by nine recommendations that seek to align technological advancement with ethical responsibility and economic opportunity, ensuring long-term growth and success of the UK screen sector.\n\nHow this case study aligns with the roadmap\n\nSwitching from using large language models in the cloud to a small language model that runs on-device can be a positive step towards carbon minimisation, as it avoids the cost and energy use associated with LLM inference and cloud compute.\nMeaning Machine’s partnership with Nvidia demonstrates the sort of cross-discipline collaboration that will help deliver responsible AI for the screen sector. The partnership between AI developer and game designer has resulted in an AI solution tailored to the needs of a specific game experience.\nMeaning Machine’s AI innovations have been supported by funding from the MyWorld programme, illustrating one way in which investment drives the emergence of new creative technologies and new creative technology businesses.\nDead Meat is an example of UK creators leveraging AI technologies to pursue new storytelling ideas, formats and concepts."
