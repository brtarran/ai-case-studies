    "text": "Application of AI\nDead Meat’s responsive dialogue is generated by language models. Early versions of the game used cloud-based large language models (LLM), but cloud-based LLMs introduce cost and latency issues, as well requiring players to have an always-on internet connection. Meaning Machine has since partnered with Nvidia to fine-tune a language model that is small enough to run locally, on a player’s GPU. The model was fine-tuned on Meaning Machine’s own dialogue data and is now integrated with the company’s Game Conscious AI system.\n\n\n\n\n\n“We are pretty optimistic about AI… not as a productivity tool, not as something to build things faster and cheaper. We are optimistic about AI as something that can unlock new forms of creative self-expression for developers and create new types of experience for players that radically change the shape of what video games look like.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Keane, co-founder and creative lead, Meaning Machine speaking at Game Developers Conference, May 1, 2025"

The partnership between AI developer and game designer has resulted in an AI solution tailored to the needs of a specific game experience.\n\n\n\nInvestment\n\nMeaning Machine’s AI innovations have been supported by funding from the MyWorld programme, illustrating one way in which investment drives the emergence of new creative technologies and new creative technology businesses.\n\n\n\nIndependent creation\n\nDead Meat is an example of UK creators leveraging AI technologies to pursue new storytelling ideas, formats and concepts."

    "text": "Ada Eden is an independent game development team founded by Yuqian Sun, an AI narrative researcher and artist based in London. The team’s first project is 1001 Nights, in which players take on the role of Shahrzad, a young woman married to a murderous king. The player, as Shahrzad has the power to turn language into reality. Shahrzad must avoid execution at dawn by creating and telling stories that prompt the king to mention words such as “sword”, “shield” or other types of weapon. These items will appear in the game world and can later be used by Shahrzad to fight the king. The game’s mechanics are made possible by the use of language models to create story and dialogue interactions with the king. Language models are also used to summarise player-created stories and prompt image-generation models to create visual depictions of story scenes. These images are then presented in-game.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot from 1001 Nights, copyright Yuqian Sun / Ada Eden."

    "text": "Application of AI\nThe earliest version of 1001 Nights was developed in 2020, when Sun was a master’s student at Goldsmiths, University of London. The original game demo used a fine-turned version of OpenAI’s GPT-2 model, but in a 2023 paper, Sun et al. describe how:\n\nPlayers guide the LLM-driven King in co-creating narratives, with GPT-4 employing LLM reasoning methods to ensure story consistency. As these narratives progress, the depicted world is dynamically generated and visualized through Stable Diffusion, blurring the boundaries between narrative and in-game reality.\n\nIn their paper, Sun and colleagues propose the term “AI-Native games” to categorise “innovative games where GenAI is fundamental to the game’s novel mechanics and very existence”.\n\n\n\n\n\n“When we started this game as an art and academic project, our guiding principle was to use AI only to create novel gaming experiences that were previously impossible, not to replace human creativity in any way. In other words, without AI technology, the game mechanics could not be realized. Inspired by the ancient Persian folklore, the game’s soul comes from us, the human creators, not the AI technology itself. AI is just the means by which this vision is brought to life and shared with you.”\n\n\n\n\n\nQuote taken from Ada Eden’s AI content disclosure statement for 1001 Nights.
